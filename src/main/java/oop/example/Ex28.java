        //Adding Numbers
        /*In previous programs, you asked the user for repeated input by writing the
        input statements multiple times. But itâ€™s more efficient to use loops to deal
        with repeated input.
        Write a program that prompts the user for five numbers and computes the total of the numbers.
        Example Output
            Enter a number: 1
            Enter a number: 2
            Enter a number: 3
            Enter a number: 4
            Enter a number: 5
            The total is 15.
        Constraints
            The prompting must use repetition, such as a counted loop, not three separate prompts.
            Create a flowchart before writing the program.*/
